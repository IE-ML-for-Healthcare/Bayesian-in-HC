    "This notebook tackles the classic **Monty Hall Problem** to demonstrate two fundamental, yet complementary, approaches to probability and inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Frequentist (Monte Carlo Simulation)**: Estimating probabilities through the long-run relative frequency of outcomes in repeated, independent trials (simulations).\n",
    "* **Bayesian (Bayes' Theorem)**: Updating our initial belief (**prior**) about an outcome based on new evidence (**likelihood**) to form a refined belief (**posterior**).\n",

    "1.  **Three Doors**: One car (the prize) and two goats are placed randomly behind doors 1, 2, and 3\n",
    "2.  **Player's Initial Choice**: The player picks one door, $\\mathbf{D}_{\\text{pick}}$, uniformly at random (could have chosen any one)\n",
    "3.  **Host's Action**: The host (who knows where the car is) opens one of the *other* two doors, $D_{open}$, revealing a goat\n",
    "4.  **The Offer**: The host always offers the player the choice to **stay** with their initial pick or **switch** to the other remaining closed door, $D_{switch}$\n",
    "5.  **Host's Rules (Crucial)**:\n",
    "    * The host must always open one of the doors the player did not pick\n",
    "    * The host must always open a door with a goat (not the one with the car)\n",
    "    * If the host has two goat doors to choose from (i.e. the player's initial pick was the car), the host chooses which goat door to open uniformly at random (50/50)"

    "> ### After the evidence (the host opening a goat door), the probability that the car is behind your original door ($\\mathbf{D = 1}$) remains $\\mathbf{1/3}$. The probability that the car is behind the other closed door ($C = 2$) increases to $\\mathbf{2/3}$. Switching doubles your chance of winning!!🚗🥳"
